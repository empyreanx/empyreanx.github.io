        <h2>Features currently supported by the engine:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Graphics (sprites/animations) using custom 2D renderer (with batching draw calls for performance)</li>
            <li>Music and basic 2D positional audio</li>
            <li>Basic 2D physics (linear and rotational kinematics, but only linear dynamics). This physics engine can be swapped out for a more powerful one if needed.</li>
            <li>High-performance, multi-threaded architecture</li>
            <li>ECS (Entity-Component-System) framework for rapid development of game logic</li>
            <li>Particle systems (designed, but not implemented yet)</li>
            <li>Basic AI support (finite state machines)</li>
            <li>Tool support: PhysicsEditor, TexturePacker, and Tiled editor (tile map loading and rendering)</li>
            <li>Platform support via SDL for PC (Window, Linux, MacOS), mobile (Android, iOS), and possibly consoles (PS5, Xbox, and others...)</li>
