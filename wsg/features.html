        <h2>Features currently supported by the engine:</h2>
        <p><b>Foundational features. Most of the work involved contributions to <a href="https://github.com/empyreanx/pico_headers">pico_headers</a> (ECS, renderer, math, collision detection/spatial paritioning, logging, unit testing), so what is listed here is only the tip of the iceberg.</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Graphics (sprites/animations) using custom 2D renderer (with batching draw calls for performance)</li>
            <li>Music and basic 2D positional audio</li>
            <li>Basic 2D physics (linear and rotational kinematics, but only linear dynamics). This physics engine can be swapped out for a more powerful one if needed.</li>
            <li>High-performance, multi-threaded architecture</li>
            <li>ECS (Entity-Component-System) framework for rapid development of game logic</li>
            <li>Tool support: PhysicsEditor, TexturePacker, and Tiled editor (orthogonal tile map loading and rendering)</li>
            <li>Platform support via SDL for PC (Window, Linux, MacOS), mobile (Android, iOS), and possibly consoles (PS5, Xbox, Switch, and others...)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planned features for alpha release (est. 2.5 months):</h2>
        <p><b>Essential features to be implemented before breaking ground on a full-fleged game (can happen in parallel to game design).</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Write pico_ecs version 3.0 and integrate into existing codebase</li>
            <li>Physics body/shapes serialization/deserialization (partially implemented)</li>
            <li>Particle systems</li>
            <li>Font handling/text rendering</li>
            <li>Rendering context support for Metal and D3D</li>
            <li>Indexed rendering</li>
            <li>Basic AI support (finite state machines)</li>
            <li>Raycasting (ECS component/system?)</li>
            <li>HUD rendering/update</li>
            <li>Menu system (microui for now)</li>
            <li>Screen transitions/effects</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Planned features for beta release (est. 3+ months):</h2>
        <p><b>These features will be implemented in parallel with game development. Some of the work will involve contributions to <a href="https://github.com/empyreanx/pico_headers">pico_headers</a>.</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Isometric tile map loading and rendering</li>
            <li>Contact points/rotational dynamics</li>
            <li>Dynamic tree for broadphase collision detection</li>
            <li>More realistic positional audio</ll>
            <li>Networking support (HTTPS/UDP)/headless mode</li>
            <li>More AI algorithms (movement, decision making, pathfinding, strategy and tactics)</li>
            <li>Async resource loading</ll>
            <li>UTF-8/localization (i18n)</li>
        </ul>
